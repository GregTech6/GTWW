# GregTech WeaponWorks
A GT6 Addon that adds features including guns, melee weapons, tech utilities, and more. Warning before viewing the code: a lot of it is highly inefficient because I just bolted on features without refactoring. Also, some of the comments I made are pretty bad. If you want to contribute, feel free to make a PR or send me a message on discord.
